# Vita3K iOS bootstrap

This directory is an experimental, device-only iOS application shell for a future Vita3K port. It currently builds an unsigned IPA containing a UIKit/Metal bootstrap screen and file-backed logging. It does **not** yet link or run the Vita3K emulator core.

The separation is intentional: upstream's current Apple target is a macOS desktop application using Qt, Cocoa, SDL, MoltenVK, and desktop-oriented dependency builds. Those pieces cannot simply be linked into an iOS application.

## Current result

- `arm64` iPhone/iPad application bundle
- unsigned IPA produced by GitHub Actions
- UIKit lifecycle and an `MTKView` rendering host
- unified logging plus `Documents/vita3k.log`
- a narrow C++ `CoreBridge` seam for future core integration
- no signing credentials or provisioning profiles in CI

See [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) for the integration backlog and known blockers. See [docs/ios-development.md](../docs/ios-development.md) for the complete Windows-first workflow.

## Build contract

The iOS shell is selected before upstream desktop dependencies are configured:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-ios -G Xcode \
  -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphoneos \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DVITA3K_BUILD_IOS=ON \
  -DVITA3K_IOS_LINK_CORE=OFF

cmake --build build-ios --config Release --target Vita3KiOS -- \
  -sdk iphoneos CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```

This command requires macOS and Xcode; the GitHub Actions workflow runs it remotely for Windows contributors.

Setting `VITA3K_IOS_LINK_CORE=ON` intentionally stops configuration with a useful error until the portability work in `PORTING.md` is complete. This prevents a bootstrap-only IPA from being mistaken for a working emulator.
